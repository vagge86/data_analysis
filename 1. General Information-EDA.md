### <ins>Descriptive analysis</ins>

General Observations regarding the dataset:

:zap: Aggregate function to calculate total sales and how many times customers used the machines (individual sales)
```ruby
SELECT location, (sum(RQty)) as Sales, (count(RQty)) as Individual_Sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by location
Order by Sales desc;
```

:speech_balloon: The vast majority of the people who use the vending machines in all locations buy only a single product.

:zap: Aggregate functions to calculate the total of unique products for each category along with the total Revenue they generated
```ruby
Select CATEGORY, COUNT(DISTINCT (Product)) as Number_of_Products,(sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by CATEGORY
Order by Number_of_Products desc;
```

:speech_balloon: The majority of sales and revenue generated comes from "Food" product sales. This category has by far the largest number of individual products.
Second comes the category "Carbonated" with a surprisingly narrow range of products which individually perform very well.
Third and fourth place respectively with large distance from the other two categories come the "Water" and "Non Carbonated" which also offer a narrow offer of individual products.

---
:zap: Nested query to calculate the % of transactions performed with each of the two given transaction methods
```ruby
Select Round(((select sum(rqty)
from sakila.vending_machine_sales
where type="credit")/sum(rqty)) * 100,2) as Percentage_of_Credit_Transactions,
Round(((select sum(rqty)
from sakila.vending_machine_sales
where type="cash")/sum(rqty)) * 100,2) as Percentage_of_Cash_Transactions
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales;
```

:speech_balloon: The query shows that 65% of the transactions are being excecuted using cash and only 35% using credit. This shows a distinct preference of the customers towards cash transactions.

---
:zap: Transformation of thet Prcd Date column to string in order to perform the LEFT function in the following query. As the first number in the column Prcd Date is the month we can isolate each month by selecting the first character from the left side and examine the monthly performace.
```ruby
ALTER TABLE sakila.vending_machine_sales   
MODIFY `Prcd Date` CHAR(20);  

SELECT LEFT(`Prcd Date`, 1) as Month, (sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY Month
```

:speech_balloon: Regarding the seasonal trend the first three months are perfoming comparatively badly but as mentioned before the location "EB Public Library" started operating on the 14th of March which has driven all sales upwards eversince. The best performing month overall is (7th) July.

:zap: Query for the best 5 selling products overall:
```ruby
Select product,sum(RQty) as Sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by product
ORDER BY Sales desc
LIMIT 5;
```
