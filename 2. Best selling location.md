#### Which is the best selling location?

At first glance the location "Gutten Plans" is the best selling location.

SQL Query: 

```ruby
Select location, (sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by location
Order by Sales desc;
```

‚ùï However after carefully examining our dataset we can see by selecting only the the location "EB Public Library" at the dashboard that it started operating in March.

**If we exclude the first two months the outcome is the following:**

From the images above it is obvious that March sales are low which leads us to check our dataset the first day of operations. 

The first day this location operated is the 14 March which means the first complete month of operation is April. 

**So from April onwards the location (From this month onwards all locations in comparison are fully operating) "EB Public Library" is the best selling location.**

#### <ins>Answer</ins>: Totally the location "Gutten Plans" is the best selling location since the end of the year. Its momentum however is on par with the location "EB Public Library" which started operating on the 14th of March and since then both locations show almost identical sales and revenue, with "EB Public Library" being marginally in the first place.

**- It is important to mention that the location "Brunswick Sq Mall" operates with 2 separate machines which perform together with the one from "Earle Asphalt" at a very simlar level and significantly worse than the matchines in the locations "Gutten Plans" and "EB Public Library"**
```ruby
Select Machine, (sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by Machine
Order by Sales desc;
```
