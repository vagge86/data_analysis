The vast majority of the people who use the vending machines in all locations buy only a single product.

```ruby
Select CATEGORY, COUNT(DISTINCT (Product)) as Number_of_Products,(sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by CATEGORY
Order by Number_of_Products desc;
```

The majority of sales and revenue generated comes from "Food" product sales. This category has by far the largest number of individual products.
Second comes the category "Carbonated" with a surprisingly narrow range of products which individually perform very well.
Third and fourth place respectively with large distance from the other two categories come the "Water" and "Non Carbonated" which also offer a narrow offer of individual products.

```ruby
Select Round(((select sum(rqty)
from sakila.vending_machine_sales
where type="credit")/sum(rqty)) * 100,2) as Percentage_of_Credit_Transactions,
Round(((select sum(rqty)
from sakila.vending_machine_sales
where type="cash")/sum(rqty)) * 100,2) as Percentage_of_Cash_Transactions
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales;
```

The query shows that 65% of the transactions are being excecuted using cash and only 35% using credit. This shows a distinct preference of the customers towards cash transactions.
