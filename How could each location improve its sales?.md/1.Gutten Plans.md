**1. Gutten Plans**

This location performs very well, especially when it comes to their excellent performance in the category "Carbonated" in comparison to the other locations.
However it is evident that the location does not offer any "Water" products. As we saw in the previous part the product "Poland Springs Water" is one of the top 5 best selling and grossing products and it would be definetly considered adding. It is followed by the product "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water" which is the 2nd best performing product in this category.

It worth adding products from the missing category and precisely two of the best selling ones.

**Suggestion:** The differentiation of the product offer with the addition of the "Water" products and specifically "Poland Springs Water" & "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water".
