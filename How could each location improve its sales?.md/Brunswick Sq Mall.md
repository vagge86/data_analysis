This leads us to focus on the drinking categories where we see that this location is the best perfoming in the category "Water". This leads us to seek ways to maximize the sales in the other two categories which seem to have good performance but also room for improvement as the client's preferences in this location seem to favour products from these categories.

The products "Starbucks Doubleshot Energy - Mocha" and "Snapple Diet Tea - Lemon" are in the top 5 sold product overall but not offered in this location.

**Suggestion:** Include the products "Sunkist Soda - Orange","Starbucks Doubleshot Energy - Mocha" and "Snapple Diet Tea - Lemon" which can boost sales to the categories "Carbonated" and "Non Carbonated" which seem to be favoured by the clients.
