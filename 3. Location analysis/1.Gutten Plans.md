:eyes:Observations: 
- No water products offered. 
- Customers prefer "Carbonated" and "Food" products which perform significantly well.
- Many products offered with low sales.

```ruby
Select product, sum(RQty) as Sales,sum(RQty*RPrice) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
where category="Water"

Product Revenue: 704.75/4882.75 (14.5%).

:bulb: The above percentages show that the demand doesn't really value variety and is concentrated in a limited range of products.

:bulb:Food and carbonated drinks are dominating the demand. Top 5 selling products in these categories for this location:

:bulb:The above products are recommended to be allocated extra space.

<ins>**Suggestions:** </ins>

- Test the addition of the "Water" products and specifically "Poland Springs Water" & "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water".

- To test the allocation of extra space to the most successful products and stop offering products with minimal sales.
