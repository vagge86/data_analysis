Observations: 
- No water products offered. 
- Customers prefer "Carbonated" and "Food" products which perform significantly well.
- Many products offered with low sales.

This location performs very well, especially when it comes to their excellent performance in the category "Carbonated" in comparison to the other locations.
However the location does not offer any "Water" products. "Poland Springs Water" is one of the top 5 best selling products and it would be definetly considered adding. It is followed by the product "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water" which is the 2nd best performing product in this category. 
```ruby
select count(*)
from(
Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a;
Select location,product,sum(RQty) as Sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by product
HAVING Sales < 25
```

At the same time 46/72 product codes have sold less than 25 prodcuts each and in order to take full advantage the limited space some low performing prodcuts should be replaced with others with good performance.
Query to count the products with sales fewwe than 25 followed by the total different products offered in this vending machine.
```ruby
SELECT
(select count(*)
from(
Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a) as Low_Performing_Products,
(Select count(*) as Products
from
(Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product) as b) Total_Number_of_Products
```

Finally we see that 46/72 products have low total sales (<25)

and regarding the sales and revenue percentage they contribute to the total as follows:
```ruby
SELECT
(select sum(sales)
from(
Select product,sum(RQty) as sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a) as Sales_Low_Performing_Products,
(Select sum(sales)
from
(Select product,sum(RQty) as sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product) as b) Total_Sales
```
After executing the above query, the sales volume of the 46 low performing products mentioned above out of the 72 available products represent 462/2594 of total sales (17.8%):

Finally if the above query is transformed to query revenue instead of sales it will how the following result:

704.75/4882.75 Is the ratio of the revenue generated by the 46 least performing products (14.5%).

**Suggestion:** The addition of the "Water" products and specifically "Poland Springs Water" & "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water" along with rearranging of the available space to promote the best selling products and reduce the low selling products mentioned above.
