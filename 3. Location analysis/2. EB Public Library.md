Observations:

- High food sales
- Lower but balanced demand from the other 3 categories
- Suprisingly no food product is within the top 3 best performing products despite dominating in this location. This implies strong demand dispersion in the food category.

This location has great momentum and the sales spread across all categories. However it might be worth it to explore the possibility of replicating the success
of the location "Guten Plans" in the category "Carbonated", as it seems that the demand in this location is balanced if we exclude the category "Food".

So let's compare the "Carbonated" Sales between this and the other three locations:

Sales of Carbonated in the 3 locations:

vs EB Public Library:

"Monster Energy Original","Sunkist Soda - Orange" and "Red Bull - Original" have great performance overall in the location Gutten Plans and introducing them to the current location can boost the sales.

**<ins>Assumption:**</ins> The demand is dipersed at least for food category. We will now explore the validity of this assumption.
If low selling products (>25 sales) represent a significant amount of the total sales we can consider the assumption validated.
In case of validation we would like to keep the product range as wide as possible. 
In case of rejection we would like to substitute low selling products with high performing ones.

Sales Query: 
```ruby
SELECT
(select sum(sales)
from(
Select product,sum(RQty) as sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="EB Public Library"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a) as Sales_Low_Performing_Products,
(Select sum(sales)
from
(Select product,sum(RQty) as sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="EB Public Library"
Group by Product) as b) Total_Sales
```
Revenue Query:
```ruby
SELECT
(select sum(Revenue)
from(
Select product,sum(RQty*RPrice) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="EB Public Library"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a) as Rvenue_Low_Performing_Products,
(Select sum(Revenue)
from
(Select product,sum(RQty*RPrice) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="EB Public Library"

```

**Overall sales and revenue of low selling products:**

From the above images we see that low selling products represent a significant amount of sales and revenue (36.5% & 39.5% respectively). 

**Sales and revenue of low selling products excluding the category food:**

The percentages 36.5 & 39.5 change to 19.7% and 23.33%.

**Sales and revenue of low selling products only including the category food:**

Sales and revenue percentage of low performing food products: 46.72% & 50.8%

From the above I consider the assumption validated only for the category food, and rejected for the other three.

**<ins>Suggestions:</ins>** 
- Food is dominating this location and the demand is disperesed along the product range leading us to keep it as wide as possible.
- In the other three categories it would make sense to try and substitute low selling products with 
  1. Good performing ones
  2. Introduce new products like the ones mentioned below
- Test the introduction of the products: 
  1. "Monster Energy Original"
  2. "Sunkist Soda - Orange" 
  3. "Red Bull - Original"
