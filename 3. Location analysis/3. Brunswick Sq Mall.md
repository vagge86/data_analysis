:eyes:Observations:

- Food is the best selling category but not dominant
- Balanced demand for all four categories
- Very good Water performance in comparison to the other locations.
- "Poland Spring Water" is the best performing product

This location has two low performing vending machines:
```ruby
Select Machine, (sum(RQty)) as Sales, (sum(RQty*RPrice)) as Revenue
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
Group by Machine
Order by Sales desc;
```

:question:There are no data regarding the cost of running two vending machines we can't decide wether it is logical (profit wise) to keep them both or focus only on one like the other 3 locations. On the other hand two locations offer twice the profit potential if sales increase.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:There is no product standing out saleswise which shows demand dispersion in a wide variety of products:

- The categories Food and Water perform well so the analyisis should focus on improving the other two categories:
