**1. Gutten Plans**

This location performs very well, especially when it comes to their excellent performance in the category "Carbonated" in comparison to the other locations.
However it is evident that the location does not offer any "Water" products. As we saw in the previous part the product "Poland Springs Water" is one of the top 5 best selling and grossing products and it would be definetly considered adding. It is followed by the product "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water" which is the 2nd best performing product in this category.
