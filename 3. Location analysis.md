Observations: 
- No water products offered. 
- Customers prefer "Carbonated" and "Food" products which perform significantly well.
- Many products offered with low sales.

This location performs very well, especially when it comes to their excellent performance in the category "Carbonated" in comparison to the other locations.
However the location does not offer any "Water" products. "Poland Springs Water" is one of the top 5 best selling products and it would be definetly considered adding. It is followed by the product "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water" which is the 2nd best performing product in this category. 
```ruby
select count(*)
from(
Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a;
Select location,product,sum(RQty) as Sales
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by product
HAVING Sales < 25
```

At the same time 46/72 product codes have sold less than 25 prodcuts each and in order to take full advantage the limited space some low performing prodcuts should be replaced with others with good performance.
Query to count the products with sales fewwe than 25 followed by the total different products offered in this vending machine.
```ruby
SELECT
(select count(*)
from(
Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product
HAVING sum(RQty) < 25) as a) as Low_Performing_Products,
(Select count(*) as Products
from
(Select count(Product)
FROM sakila.vending_machine_sales
WHERE location="GuttenPlans"
Group by Product) as b) Total_Number_of_Products
```

Finally we see that 46/72 products have low total sales (<25)

It worth adding products from the missing category and precisely two of the best selling ones.

**Suggestion:** The addition of the "Water" products and specifically "Poland Springs Water" & "S. Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water". 

From the above graph we can find out that there abovementioned 6 products stand out in terms of selling and grossing and all the other products comprise a cluster of proucts with significantly lower performance. However from the cluster the product :"Coca Cola - Regular" stands out as it only sold during the last 3 months and performs very well.
