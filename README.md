The analysis of this dataset has as goal to demonstrate descriptive analysis and dashboard creation in Excel and Power BI.
The dataset regarding sales of vending machines in 4 locations in Central New Jersey.

The questions that will be answered are the following:

1. Which is the best selling location?
2. Which are the top 5 best selling/grossing products?
3. How could each location improve its sales?

Methodology: 1. Overview of the dataset in Excel, creation of pivot tables with the most important information and using their graphs to create a comprehensive dashboard. Subsequently a similar comprehensive dashboard is created in Power BI in oder to answer the above questions.

**Preparation**: 
1. There are blank cells in the Category column in the original dataset and 3 lines with both Category and Product blank. Those 3 lines are not taken into account, the missing category items were filled manually by Google searching the respective products. 
2. For our analysis it is useful to isolate the month each transaction took place. This was achieved by splitting the "TransDate" column using the "Text to Columns" feature in Excel.
3. For the purpose of the analysis I created an analysis table using only the columns necessary for analyzing our dataset.
