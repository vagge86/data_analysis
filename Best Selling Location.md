Additionally we see that March sales are low which leads us to check our dataset the first day of operations. The first day this location operated is the 14 March which means the first complete month of operation is April. So from April onwards the location (From this month onwards all locations in comparison are fully operating) "EB Public Library" is the best selling location.
