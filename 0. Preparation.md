1. Overview of the dataset in Excel, creation of pivot tables with the most important information and using their graphs to create a comprehensive dashboard. Subsequently a similar comprehensive dashboard is created in Power BI in oder to answer the above questions.

**Data Cleaning**:
To ensure data integrity the following steps were taken
1. There are blank cells in the Category column in the original dataset and 3 lines with both Category and Product blank. Those 3 lines are not taken into account, the missing category items were filled manually by Google searching the respective products. 
2. For our analysis it is useful to isolate the month each transaction took place. This was achieved by splitting the "TransDate" column using the "Text to Columns" feature in Excel.
3. For the purpose of the analysis I created an analysis table using only the columns necessary for analyzing our dataset.
4. I created a pivot table in excel groupping all products by category to find out if visually there were products obviously not fitting their assigned category.The products "Keto Krisp - Almond/Chocolate" and "Keto Krisp - Almond Butter" were wrongly assigned to the category "Carbonated" and have been manually reassigned to the correct category: "Food". 
5. No other inconsistencies were spotted.
